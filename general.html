Not every person in the Pokemon world has a profession that is centered around raising Pokemon, whether that be for battles or performance! Still, there are many professions that involve Pokemon, even though the individual may not need to raise them themselves. For example, Pokemon Professors in this world hold a very valuable place in the community. Not only do they study Pokemon and advance society’s understanding of these creatures, they also support early Pokemon Trainer development by providing “starter pokemon” to local children. Nurse Joy’s who occupy the many Pokemon hospitals in the world, also work closely with Chansey, though Chansey are treated like coworkers, not as Pokemon to battle with. Nurse Joy does not need to capture and raise her own Chansey’s, as there is a school for Chansey’s to learn how to be Nurse Joy’s aid.

At times, professions do have Pokemon that they raise themselves that help support their work. For example, construction workers often own fighting or rock type Pokemon to help them move debris, and electricians often have electric type Pokemon to help keep things charged. Pokemon do not always have to work, however. Sometimes Pokemon are treated as pets as well. Children as young as 4 have been seen with Pokemon, even though they are too young to be an official Pokemon trainer. Families can have Pokemon as pets, with popular pet Pokemon being Skitty or Glameow.
